# guesaddiionsinstaller
I created this tool to simplify your life. because when you install the guest additions on virtual box there are 2000 commands :)
but with this creation they will become just one command. this file .sh and only for debian and ubuntu.

Type these three commands into the terminal
1. cd your folder
2. chmod +rx  vbox_additions_installer.sh
3. ./ vbox_additions_installer.sh

if you want you can insert the iso
